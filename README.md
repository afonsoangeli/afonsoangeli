<h2>Professional Profile</h3>
<p>Hi! ðŸ˜€</p>
Iâ€™m @afonsoangeli, I've been working as a developer for over 3 years, and i am a .NET specialist. I've had experience as a full stack, but my passion is work as back-end developer.
I also have knowledge in SCRUM, Azure DevOps, SQL Server, Cloud FireStore, Object-oriented programming (OOP), SQL, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript. I'm always looking for new knowledge, currently i'm learning NodeJs.

<h2>More about me</h2>
In my spare time, I love to play, and I am a love to work out.
I believe that knowledge only gains value when it is shared, so whenever possible, I like to pass on everything I learn!! ðŸ¥°
